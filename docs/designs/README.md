# CrossPool Design Map

The documents in this directory describe the implemented and accepted CrossPool
system. Active changes live under `docs/plans/`; the design map stays focused on
current architecture while workflow history remains in version control.

- [System Overview](overview.md) defines the supported boundary, process roles,
  public interface ownership, and cross-module invariants.
- [Control Plane](control-plane.md) defines configuration, generation planning,
  placement, memory admission, role preparation, managed attention MPS, and
  ordered participant retirement.
- [Transport](transport.md) defines the Instance-to-AtnAgent mailbox.
- [Fabric](fabric.md) defines distributed invocation, coordination, delivery,
  scheduling, and failure.
- [FFN Execution](ffn-execution.md) defines model materialization, operators,
  GraphTemplates, and Executor Lanes.
- [Elastic KV Cache Pooling](elastic-kv-cache.md) defines stable attention-side
  KV storage, logical admission, physical capacity coordination, and
  reclamation.
- [Devkit](devkit.md) defines Hook Points and observer evidence.
- [Test and Benchmark Tooling](tooling.md) defines installed harness ownership,
  configuration, catalogues, shared resource lifecycle and test evidence.
- [Serving Benchmarks](benchmark.md) defines workloads, measurements,
  continuation and offline reports.
- [Qualification](qualification.md) defines readiness and acceptance evidence.

The root [CONTEXT.md](../../CONTEXT.md) owns domain terminology. An active plan
is a scoped delta over these current documents; source declarations and
generated native stubs remain authoritative for exact interfaces. Completed
plans leave this map after user-confirmed cleanup through `write-design`.

The [Roadmap](../plans/README.md) lists long-term candidate workstreams and
their relationships. Accepted architecture and active plans live in the
documents linked above.
