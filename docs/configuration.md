# Configuration

CrossPool configuration is shared by the daemon, AtnAgents, FfnAgents, and
SGLang Instances. Start from [`configs/xpool.example.toml`](../configs/xpool.example.toml)
for deployment settings and [`.env.example`](../.env.example) for process
environment settings. Keep machine-local paths in an ignored `*.local.toml`
file and load `.env` into `uv run` commands with `UV_ENV_FILE`.

The [Control Plane design](designs/control-plane.md#configuration-and-integration)
defines configuration semantics and validation contracts. This page is the
user-facing reference for selecting and inspecting those values.

## Sources and precedence

Supported sources take precedence in this order:

1. CLI arguments
2. Allowlisted environment variables
3. The TOML file selected by `XPOOL_CONFIG`
4. Defaults

Each setting declares its accepted sources. Use the command's `--help` for
available CLI overrides and `.env.example` for common environment overrides.
Debug controls use their registered environment variables. For example, set
`XPOOL_DEBUG_GRAPH_OBSERVER_ENABLE`; debug settings have no TOML section.

Bootstrap environment variables are separate from the TOML schema:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `XPOOL_CONFIG` | Selects the runtime TOML file. |
| `XKIT_CONFIG` | Selects the xtest/xbench development TOML file. |
| `SGLANG_PLUGINS=xpool` | Loads the CrossPool SGLang plugin. |
| `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | Selects ordered physical devices by `nvidia-smi` index or full UUID. |

All entries in one deployment use the same resolved configuration and original
device visibility. Runtime entries normalize the complete view to UUIDs and
install MPS pipe/log variables before driver initialization: attention uses the
daemon-owned endpoint, while FFN uses an empty pipe value to bypass MPS. Keep
endpoint selection out of machine-local `.env` files. See
[managed startup](designs/control-plane.md#startup-and-shutdown).

## Development tools and shared cache

Copy `configs/xkit.example.toml` to ignored `configs/xkit.local.toml` and select it
with `XKIT_CONFIG` or a tool leaf's `--config FILE`. The root owns `keep_runs`;
the `xtest` tree owns catalogue, default suites and strict requirements; the
`xbench` tree owns catalogue, repetition count and report presentation. Runtime
topology and model paths remain in `configs/xpool.local.toml`, selected by
`XPOOL_CONFIG`.

Allowed overrides retain CLI > environment > TOML > default precedence.
Run selections (`--all`, `--case`, pytest inputs) and report export destinations
are invocation actions. They are not stored as configured defaults. An explicitly
selected unreadable or malformed configuration file fails the command.

`cache_root` belongs to runtime configuration and is shared by both tools and
`xpool memory-profile`. Select it through runtime TOML, `XPOOL_CACHE_ROOT` or
an applicable command's `--cache-root`. Tools resolve only this runtime setting
for storage; model and topology validation waits for an operation that needs
them. Development TOML does not declare a second cache root.

Relative TOML catalogue and cache paths resolve against their declaring file.
Relative CLI, environment and default paths resolve against the invocation
directory. Paths in retained tool settings are absolute. Default catalogue paths
expect the checkout as the invocation directory. From elsewhere, select absolute
configuration file paths with TOML catalogue paths relative to those files, or
provide explicit catalogue paths.

The shared root contains `test-runs/`, `bench-runs/` and temporary
`memory-profile/` workspaces. Profiling's final calibration file remains at
`ffn.device_memory_calibration`. Explicit `clean` commands affect only their
tool's run subtree. Python bytecode follows the interpreter and user's
`PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`/`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` policy.

Inspect both the effective development settings and their sources with:

```bash
uv run xtest config dump
uv run xbench config dump
```

Report settings include layout, unique output formats, raster PPI, legend
visibility/location/columns and per-figure dimensions, subplot columns and
Markdown captions. `--layout` selects a preset width; explicit widths override
it. Common `--width`/`--height` override all three figures. Complex text and
per-figure settings stay in TOML. See the
[tooling tutorial](tutorials/tooling.md) for the complete command workflow.

## Native build settings

`uv sync` does not load `.env` through `UV_ENV_FILE`. Its native build uses
CMake's default CUDA architecture list unless you pass a build setting. For an
A100-only build, append this option to `uv sync`:

```text
--config-settings-package xpool:cmake.define.XPOOL_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=80-real
```

Choose the architectures required by the selected devices; this is not a runtime
configuration setting. To reuse the override across builds in one shell,
including the pre-commit native-build hook, export
`CMAKE_ARGS=-DXPOOL_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=80-real` before running the commands.
Without that export, the hook builds the default architecture list. See the
[Quick Start installation step](tutorials/quick-start.md#install)
for a complete `uv sync` command.

## TOML overview

The following is a selected configuration overview, not a complete schema
reference:

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `cache_root` | Shared artifact and profiling workspace root; default `.xpool-cache`. |
| `daemon.host` / `daemon.port` | Selects the local control-plane address; SGLang serving uses its own listener. |
| `vendor.model_base_uri` | Sets the absolute local model root. |
| `models[].id` / `models[].path` | Identifies a model and optionally overrides its absolute local weight path. |
| `models[].atn_tp_size` | Fixes attention TP width; omission resolves from the Attention World and the model's DP size. |
| `models[].atn_dp_size` | Partitions the Attention World into DP groups; defaults to one. |
| `models[].ffn_tp_size` | Fixes the model's FFN tensor-parallel width; omission uses the number of FfnAgents. |
| `scheduler.slo` / `models[].slo` | Sets default TTFT/TBT targets; models may override both for Elastic KV arbitration. |
| `atn.devices` / `ffn.devices` | Assigns attention-side and FFN-side deployment-visible device indices. |
| `scheduler.ffn_concurrency` | Sets the Executor Lane count, not a row or token budget. |
| `scheduler.ffn_policy` | Selects `fifo` or `random` admission. |
| `atn.device_memory_utilization` | Sets the maximum attention-device memory fraction used to freeze the Elastic KV Capacity Pool. |
| `scheduler.atn_concurrency` | Reserved for future attention compute admission; currently has no runtime effect. |
| `logging.level` / `logging.color` | Sets runtime log level and enables terminal-aware color on stderr. |
| `ffn.loader.parallelism` | Sets the number of checkpoint readers per FfnAgent. |
| `ffn.placement.parallelism` / `ffn.placement.timeout_seconds` | Sets solver workers and the whole-solve timeout in seconds. |
| `ffn.device_memory_extra_margin_bytes` | Adds an explicit device-memory admission margin. |
| `ffn.device_memory_calibration` | Selects an optional environment-qualified memory calibration profile. |

Both device lists must be nonempty. Attention forms a consecutive block starting
at zero; FFN forms the consecutive block immediately after attention. For example,
`atn.devices = [0, 1]` and `ffn.devices = [2, 3]` select the first two and next
two positions in the ordered deployment view, regardless of their host inventory
indices. Attention geometry must satisfy the
[complete-World contract](designs/control-plane.md#configuration-and-integration).

## Model paths

Each `[[models]]` entry selects local weights: an explicit `path` takes
precedence; otherwise the path is `vendor.model_base_uri / id`. For example,
`id = "Qwen/Qwen3-14B"` below `/srv/models` resolves to
`/srv/models/Qwen/Qwen3-14B`. These settings select existing local weights.
Pass the same resolved path to SGLang's `--model-path`.

## Inspecting resolved configuration

Run the configuration dump to inspect resolved values and their sources as JSON:

```bash
uv run xpool config dump
```

The [Quick Start](tutorials/quick-start.md) shows a complete two-device setup.

## Memory calibration

Memory calibration is optional: leave `ffn.device_memory_calibration` unset to
use analytic admission. To generate a profile, set it to an absolute output
path and run `uv run xpool memory-profile` with the daemon and serving processes
stopped. The profiler owns its attention MPS scope and executes FFN participants
directly. It uses a fixed model-independent corpus without loading the configured
model weights.

At startup, an explicitly configured profile must exist and match the
deployment environment; startup reports missing, malformed, or incompatible
profiles.
