# Multi-LLM Serving on Two Devices

This guide extends the [single-model quick start](quick-start.md) to serve
`Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` and `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B` together. Both Instances use the same
AtnAgent device and FfnAgent device. Complete the quick-start installation,
model-root and `.env` setup first.

## Configure both models

Stop the single-model SGLang process, then request daemon shutdown and wait for
its Agent/Fabric and MPS retirement before editing the shared configuration.

Keep the same two physical UUIDs in `.env` and the same device roles in
`configs/xpool.local.toml`:

```toml
[atn]
devices = [0]

[ffn]
devices = [1]

[[models]]
id = "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"

[[models]]
id = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B"
```

Retain the other settings from the quick start, including
`vendor.model_base_uri`. Both model paths must contain `config.json` and their
local checkpoint files. These entries select models; they do not download
weights.

## Start the shared generation

From the repository root, run `export UV_ENV_FILE="$PWD/.env"` in every terminal.
Start one daemon, one AtnAgent, and one FfnAgent:

```bash
uv run xpool daemon serve
```

```bash
uv run xpool atnagent --device 0
```

```bash
uv run xpool ffnagent --device 1
```

Then start both SGLang Instances in separate terminals, before waiting for
either one to become healthy. Replace `/absolute/path/to/models` with the
`vendor.model_base_uri` selected above:

```bash
uv run xpool exec -- sglang serve \
  --model-path /absolute/path/to/models/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 30000
```

```bash
uv run xpool exec -- sglang serve \
  --model-path /absolute/path/to/models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 31000
```

Use the same `.env` in all five terminals. Do not give the two Instances
different `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` mappings: they must agree with the daemon and
agents about the generation's device indices.

## Check both listeners

In another terminal with `UV_ENV_FILE` set, wait for System Ready and both HTTP
listeners. The daemon reports Serving Healthy only after both listeners pass
their startup health checks, but check each public endpoint before sending a
request:

```bash
until uv run xpool daemon check; do sleep 1; done
until curl --fail --silent --show-error --max-time 5 http://127.0.0.1:30000/health; do sleep 1; done
until curl --fail --silent --show-error --max-time 5 http://127.0.0.1:31000/health; do sleep 1; done
```

Send one request to each listener:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:30000/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"Explain shared device serving in one sentence.","sampling_params":{"temperature":0,"max_new_tokens":24}}'

curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:31000/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"Explain shared device serving in one sentence.","sampling_params":{"temperature":0,"max_new_tokens":24}}'
```

The two Instances keep separate logical KV contents and prefix caches while
sharing the attention device's physical KV Capacity Pool. Their model-specific
FFN weight shards coexist on the FFN device. This smoke topology covers concurrent
two-model startup and inference on those two device roles. Dynamic KV-capacity
borrowing is covered by the dedicated Elastic KV qualification.

Finish or cancel startup, then stop both SGLang Instances and wait for their
workers and helpers to exit before requesting daemon shutdown. Start no new
clients during retirement. The daemon retires the shared Agents and Fabric before
stopping its attention MPS scope.
